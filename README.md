# BombDefuser
Practice adding the interval for 10 seconds
The timer should decrement by 1 from 10 for each second.
The timer value should display in the HTML paragraph element with the id timer
If the text defuse is entered in the HTML input element with the id defuser and pressed Enter before 10 seconds,
The text You did it! should be displayed in the HTML paragraph element with the id timer
If the text "defuse" is not entered in the HTML input element with the id defuser and not pressed Enter before 10 seconds,
The text "BOOM" should be displayed in the HTML paragraph element with the id timer
